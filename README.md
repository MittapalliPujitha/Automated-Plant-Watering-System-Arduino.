# Automated-Plant-Watering-System-Arduino.
This project automates irrigation by monitoring soil moisture levels using a sensor.  When soil moisture falls below a threshold, the Arduino activates a relay to turn on a water pump.  The system reduces water wastage, human effort, and supports efficient plant care.  Built using Arduino UNO, soil moisture sensor, relay module, and water pump.
